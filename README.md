# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch  

This repository contains implementations of essential machine learning algorithms built entirely from scratch using **NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib**. It covers both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, with each algorithm trained and tested on datasets to evaluate its accuracy and performance.  

## **Implemented Algorithms**  
- **Linear Regression** – Predicts continuous target values from input features.  
- **Polynomial Regression** – Extends linear regression to model non-linear relationships.  
- **Logistic Regression** – Used for binary classification tasks.  
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** – A simple feedforward neural network for recognizing complex patterns.  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – A non-parametric classification and regression algorithm.  
- **K-Means Clustering** – An unsupervised method for grouping data into clusters.  

## **Key Features**  
- **Model Training & Evaluation** – Each algorithm is tested on multiple datasets to measure effectiveness.  
- **Minimal Dependencies** – Built using only **NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib** for data handling and visualization.  
- **No Pre-built Libraries** – Every algorithm is implemented from the ground up, offering a deeper insight into its workings.
